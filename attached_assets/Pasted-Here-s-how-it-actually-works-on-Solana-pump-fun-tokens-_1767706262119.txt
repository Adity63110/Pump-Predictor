Here’s how it actually works on Solana / pump.fun tokens 👇

1. Tracking all holders

On Solana, every token has a mint address. From that:

Each holder owns a Token Account tied to that mint

These token accounts store:

wallet address (owner)

token balance

How apps track holders

They query the Solana RPC:

getProgramAccounts (for SPL Token program)

Filter by the mint address

This instantly returns:

all wallets holding the token

exact balances

percentage of supply

That’s how pump.fun, Solscan, Birdeye, Dexscreener etc show holder lists.

No permission needed. It’s public by design.

2. Tracking the dev wallet

There’s no official “DEV” label on-chain. Apps infer it using patterns 🕵️‍♂️

Common methods:

a) Token creation trail

The wallet that:

created the token

paid deploy fees

initialized the mint
→ marked as deployer / dev

b) First liquidity wallet

Wallet that:

seeded liquidity

received initial supply
→ often tagged as dev

c) Supply movement analysis

Wallet holding a large % early

Wallet that:

sends tokens to many wallets

controls liquidity actions
→ flagged as dev / team

d) Known labels

If the wallet interacted with pump.fun deploy contracts

Or reused across launches
→ gets labeled automatically

3. How platforms show it visually

Apps maintain an indexer (their own database):

Scan every transaction

Build wallet graphs

Tag wallets (dev, whale, sniper, LP)

Update in real time

That’s why:

Dev sells are detected instantly

Holder count updates live

“Dev holding %” appears on charts

4. Can dev wallets hide?

Short answer: not really 😈

They can:

split tokens into many wallets

route through PDAs

delay sells

But:

transaction graph still links them

clustering analysis exposes patterns

advanced trackers still flag it

Transparency is baked into Solana.

5. If you want to build this

Core ingredients:

Solana RPC

SPL Token Program ID

Indexer (even a simple script works)

Balance + tx history parser

That’s exactly how pump.fun trackers are made.
