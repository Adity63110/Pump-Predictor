What the AI Outputs (Very Important)
❌ Don’t output:

“Safe”

“Profitable”

“Guaranteed”

✅ Do output:

Risk Level: Low / Medium / High

Confidence Level: Weak / Moderate / Strong

Key Reasons (this builds trust)

Example:

AI Verdict: Medium Risk
Confidence: Moderate

Reasons:

High early buyer clustering

Dev wallet holds 18% supply

Community sentiment mixed

No freeze authority detected

This feels intelligent and honest.

🔹 AI Architecture (Simple but Powerful)
Step 1: Feature Builder (Backend)

Convert raw data → clean features:

{
  "token_age_minutes": 12,
  "dev_supply_percent": 18,
  "early_buyers": 7,
  "cluster_score": 0.72,
  "w_ratio": 0.61,
  "trash_ratio": 0.39,
  "chat_warning_density": 0.28
}

Step 2: Rule + Model Hybrid (Best Approach)

Don’t go full black-box ML at first.

Use:

Rule-based scoring (fast, explainable)

AI for summary + reasoning

Example:

Hard red flags = override

Soft signals = weighted

Step 3: AI Explanation Layer

Use the AI to:

Summarize risks

Explain why something looks dangerous

Translate numbers into human language

This is where AI shines ✨

🔹 How to Present It in the App (UX)
In Token Room:

Section called “AI Insight”

Badge:

🟢 Low Risk

🟡 Medium Risk

🔴 High Risk

Expandable explanation

Important:

Always show:

“AI analysis is probabilistic and based on available data.”

🔹 Profit Angle (Handled Safely)

Instead of “profitable”, use:

“Momentum Potential”

“Survival Likelihood”

“Market Health”

Example:

“Short-term momentum appears strong, but structural risk remains.”

This avoids false promises.

🔹 Training the AI (Without Breaking Anything)

You don’t need huge datasets initially.

Start with:

Historical Pump.fun tokens

Label outcomes:

Survived

Rugged

Slow bleed

Train the AI to:

Recognize patterns, not price targets

🔹 Legal + Trust Shield (DO NOT SKIP)

In Docs + UI:

“Not financial advice”

“No guarantees”

“Educational and analytical tool”

Also avoid words like:
❌ predict
❌ guarantee
❌ profit assured

Use:
✅ assess
✅ analyze
✅ estimate risk

TL;DR

Your AI should be:

A risk analyst, not a trader

Explainable, not mysterious

Probabilistic, not absolute

Helpful, not hypey
