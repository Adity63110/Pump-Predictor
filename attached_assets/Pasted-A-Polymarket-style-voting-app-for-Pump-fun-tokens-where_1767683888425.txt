A Polymarket-style voting app for Pump.fun tokens, where anyone can paste a CA (contract address) and open a public verdict room:

Is this token a W or Trash?

The crowd decides. Data assists. No fake certainty, only signals.

How It Works (User Flow)
1. Create a Token Room

User pastes:

Contract Address (CA)

System auto-fetches:

Token name & symbol

Chart preview

Dev wallet %

Mint / freeze status

Launch time

Then the user chooses:

🟢 W (Good / Hold / Potential)

🔴 Trash (Risky / Likely Rug)

This instantly creates a public room, like a Polymarket market.

2. Voting System (Simple & Honest)

Users vote W or Trash

1 wallet = 1 vote (or weighted by reputation)

Votes are visible as:

Percentage bar

Live count

Votes lock for a short time window (prevents flip-flopping)

Example:

W: 63% 🟢 | Trash: 37% 🔴

3. Live Chat per Token 🗣️

Each token room has:

Real-time chat

Messages tagged:

🧪 “Dev wallet moved”

🐳 “Whale bought”

🚨 “LP removed”

Chat becomes the human alpha layer

This is where traders hang out.

Rug Scale (Crowd + Data = Trust)
Rug Scale Formula (Hybrid)

Combine:

🧠 User Votes (honest crowd signal)

⛓️ On-chain checks

🕵️ Historical dev behavior (if available)

Display as:

Rug Scale: 28 / 100 (Low Risk 🟢)
or
Rug Scale: 81 / 100 (High Risk 🔴)

Key:
👉 Make it clear this is probability, not financial advice.

Anti-Manipulation (Very Important)

To keep votes honest:

Wallet age minimum

Small SOL balance required to vote

Vote weight increases with:

Account age

Past accuracy (voted W on tokens that survived)

Dev wallets cannot vote on their own token

This makes your platform credible.

Polymarket-Style UI (Visual Feel)

Dark, clean, minimal

Big W vs Trash buttons

Progress bar instead of charts overload

Token rooms feel like “markets”

Home page = trending tokens + most debated

Think:

Polymarket layout

Pump.fun chaos
− clutter

Why This Is a Strong Idea 💎

Crowd intelligence works before price action

Social + data beats charts alone

No need to predict price, only survival

Traders love arguing, voting, and being right

This is sticky.
