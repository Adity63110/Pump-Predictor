Exactly. If the bar is not real, your app loses trust instantly.
So here’s the only correct way to make the bonding bar show real on-chain info, not guesses.

I’ll keep it practical and Pump.fun accurate.

🧠 Where Bonding Progress Comes From (REAL DATA)

For pump.fun tokens on Solana, bonding progress is derived from the bonding curve program state, not wallets, not price.

You need 3 real on-chain values:

Bonding Curve Account

SOL collected so far

Maximum SOL required to complete bonding

Pump.fun uses a fixed bonding cap per token.

🔗 How to Get REAL Bonding Data (Conceptually)
Step 1: Identify the Bonding Curve Account

Every pump.fun token has a bonding curve PDA

It is linked to the token mint (CA)

Your backend or AI:

Takes the token CA

Derives or fetches the bonding curve account tied to it

Step 2: Read On-Chain State (No Guessing)

From the bonding curve account, read:

sol_collected (or equivalent field)

sol_target / max_raise

These values are stored on-chain and updated every buy.

Step 3: Calculate Progress (Deterministic)
bondingProgress =
(sol_collected / sol_target) × 100


Then:

Clamp 0–100

Round to 1 decimal if you want polish

This is 100% real, verifiable, and reproducible.

📊 What the Bar Represents (Tell Users Clearly)

Label it clearly to avoid confusion:

Bonding Progress (On-chain)

Tooltip text:

Percentage of bonding curve completed based on SOL raised.

This single sentence = credibility.

🧠 Prompt for Replit / Backend AI (REAL DATA ONLY)

Paste this. It enforces honesty.

🔹 Real Bonding Progress Prompt

Fetch real on-chain bonding curve data for Pump.fun tokens.

Process:

Use the token mint address (CA) to locate the associated Pump.fun bonding curve account.

Read the current SOL collected from the bonding curve state.

Read the maximum SOL required to complete the bonding curve.

Calculate bonding progress as:
(current SOL collected / maximum SOL required) × 100

Clamp the value between 0 and 100.

Strict Rules:

Do NOT estimate or infer bonding progress

Do NOT use price or volume as a proxy

If bonding curve data cannot be fetched, display:
“Bonding data unavailable”

Display:

Show a percentage and a progress bar

Label it clearly as on-chain bonding progress
