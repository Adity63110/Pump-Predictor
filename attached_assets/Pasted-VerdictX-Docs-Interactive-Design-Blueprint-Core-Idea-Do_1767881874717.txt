VerdictX Docs — Interactive Design Blueprint
🧠 Core Idea

Docs should:

Explain how things work

Prove you’re transparent

Feel alive, not static

Think Notion + terminal + pump.fun energy.

🧭 Docs Layout (Left + Right)
🔹 Left Sidebar (Sticky)

Minimal, collapsible, smooth.

Sections:

Overview

How VerdictX Works

AI Analysis Engine

Rug Score Explained

Bonding Progress

PumpList

Voting & Rooms

Data Sources

FAQ

Active section glows in pump.fun green.

🧩 Right Content Area (Interactive)
1️⃣ Overview (Hero-style intro)

Big headline:

Transparency beats alpha.

Short explainer card with subtle animation.

2️⃣ How VerdictX Works (Step Cards)

Instead of paragraphs:

Step 1: Paste Contract
Step 2: AI + Community Analysis
Step 3: Verdict Generated

Each card expands on click.

3️⃣ AI Analysis Engine (Live Demo Feel)

Show fake/sample data in animated cards:

Dev Wallet: 12%

Insiders: 9%

Top Holders: 41%

Bonding: 67%

🪄 Numbers animate when section enters view.

Tooltip on hover:

Wallet addresses are never shown. Only percentages.

4️⃣ Rug Score (Interactive Slider)

User drags a slider:

Low Risk → Medium → High Risk

As they slide:

Text explanation updates

Color shifts smoothly

This makes the logic obvious without math walls.

5️⃣ Bonding Progress (Animated Bar)

Show:

What bonding means

Why low bonding = danger

Animated bar fills with explanation appearing beside it.

6️⃣ PumpList (Filterable)

Show sample PumpList:

SAFE

CAUTION

RISK

Let users toggle categories.

Even if data is static now, UI feels real.

7️⃣ Voting & Rooms (Visual Walkthrough)

Use mock chat bubbles:

“W”

“Trash”

“Dev holding too much”

Explain:

Votes are permanent

No wallet names

Percentages only

8️⃣ Data Sources (Trust Section)

Cards with:

On-chain data

Community signals

AI aggregation

No external API details needed. Just confidence.

9️⃣ FAQ (Accordion Style)

Click to expand.
Smooth open/close.
