🧨 What Is a Rug Score?

A Rug Score is a risk score (0–100) that estimates the probability a token can rug, dump, or be malicious.

0 = very safe

100 = extremely risky

It is not a prediction, it’s a risk aggregation based on on-chain facts.

🔍 Signals Used to Calculate Rug Score

Your AI should combine multiple weighted signals, not just one red flag.

1️⃣ Liquidity Risk (Very High Weight)

Check:

Is liquidity locked or burned?

Lock duration (minutes vs months)

% of total supply in LP

Scoring logic:

Unlocked LP → +30

Locked < 7 days → +20

LP < 10% of supply → +15

2️⃣ Dev-Controlled Supply Risk

Use what we already discussed.

Check:

% of supply controlled by dev-linked wallets

Scoring:

30% → +25

15–30% → +15

<10% → +5

3️⃣ Holder Concentration Risk

Check:

Top holders % (excluding LP)

Scoring:

Top 5 > 50% → +20

Top 3 > 35% → +15

Top 1 > 20% → +10

4️⃣ Insider Activity Risk

Behavior-based.

Check:

Early buys

Repeated wallet patterns

Early exits

Scoring:

Insider-linked supply > 20% → +20

Insider-linked supply 10–20% → +10

5️⃣ Contract Authority Risk

Check:

Mint authority still enabled

Freeze authority enabled

Can supply be changed?

Scoring:

Mint authority active → +25

Freeze authority active → +15

6️⃣ Trading Behavior Risk

Check:

Sudden volume spikes

Sharp sell-offs

Wash trading patterns

Scoring:

Extreme early volatility → +10

Abnormal buy/sell symmetry → +10

7️⃣ Metadata & Transparency Risk (Low Weight)

Check:

Missing metadata

No socials

Renounced or not

Scoring:

No metadata → +5

No socials → +5

🧮 Final Rug Score Formula
Rug Score = min(100, sum of all risk points)


Optional normalization:

Clamp between 0–100

Round to nearest integer

🎯 How to Show It in the App (UX)

Don’t scare users. Make it clean.

Example:

Rug Risk Score: 72 / 100
🔴 High Risk

Main contributors:

Liquidity not locked

High dev-controlled supply

Insider-linked activity detected

No wallet addresses. No accusations.

🧠 EXACT PROMPT (Copy–Paste for Replit / AI)

This is what you asked for 👇

🔹 Rug Score Calculation Prompt

Implement a Rug Risk Score (0–100) for Solana tokens based on aggregated on-chain risk signals.

Signals to Analyze:

Liquidity status (locked, burned, duration, % of supply)

Dev-controlled supply percentage

Top holder concentration (excluding LP and program wallets)

Insider-linked activity based on early buy and exit behavior

Contract authority status (mint authority, freeze authority)

Trading behavior (early volatility, abnormal volume patterns)

Metadata and transparency signals (missing metadata or socials)

Scoring Rules:

Assign weighted risk points to each signal

Aggregate all points into a final score

Clamp final value between 0 and 100

Output Rules (Strict):

Do NOT display wallet addresses

Display only the final Rug Score, risk level (Low / Medium / High), and contributing factors

Use probabilistic and analytical language only

UI Example Output:

Rug Risk Score: 72 / 100

Risk Level: High

Key Risks: Unlocked liquidity, high dev-controlled supply, insider-linked activity

Clearly state that the Rug Score is an analytical risk estimate, not financial advice.

🟢 Optional (Highly Recommended)

Add a confidence bar:

Data Confidence: High / Medium / Low
(based on age of token & available transactions)
